# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Looking forward to improving myself in my career goals and previous knowledge that I've had so far, this Bootcamp meant for me one of the best fits I've 
could ever found. Bearing in mind programming does not mean just learning a few languages but being multitasking and having solving skills, I decided to build
a basic project that can reach myself in an even higher level by knowing the basics of programming.
Now I can tell by myself that I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github as a base in order to become a Full Stack Developer.

## Installation

## Usage
At building this Prework Guide Project we've used HTML for the typying structure of the overall project as well as CSS to bring styles and make it easier for the user 
to explore it. As soon as you open the project through your Open Live Server at VS Code, you are going to be able to check on all of the JavaScript attributes by opening 
your console once the project is running.
Github will give us the advantage of working as a cloud storage for all of this proccess can mean, working all of them together for one common purpose: Reach the User Experience.
